## 2.1 Your first JS Function (Basic grammer)
console is an Object, but bigger than what we made in last lesson, and log is one thing that's inside of console object. 
console.log is a built-in fucntion. 

function is a piece of code that you can make and use as many times as you want.

function functionName () {} <br>
the argument is inside of (). they are like variables. <Br>
we can give anything to argument(=parament,인자), and function will take it and use it.

```js
function youare(name,age,howitis){
  console.log("You're ",name,"who is",age,"years old.","you're",howitis);
}

youare("Jian",29,"pretty");

//결과값//
>You're  Jian who is 29 years old. you're pretty
```
()안에 있는 argument가 외부에 있는 value를 받아dhk
(*argument는 variable(변수) 같은 것임.)
